Completed Tasks:
Installed Required Libraries (PyPDF2, chromadb, sentence-transformers with PyTorch)
Total installation size: ~3.5GB (includes CUDA libraries for GPU acceleration)
Created Vector Database Initialization Script (init_vector_db.py)
Extracts text from PDF (89 pages, 146,653 characters)
Splits into 175 semantic chunks with overlap for better context
Generates multilingual embeddings using paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2
Stores in ChromaDB persistent database
Updated Chatbot (chatbot.py)
Replaced KnowledgeBase class with VectorKnowledgeBase
Uses semantic search instead of keyword matching
Maintains Gemini API integration for response generation
Improved Thai language support through multilingual embeddings
Tested Successfully (test_chatbot.py)
Vector search returns contextually relevant results
Chatbot generates accurate, detailed answers
Distance scores show good semantic matching


Key Improvements:
Semantic Understanding: Now understands meaning, not just keywords
Better Thai Support: Multilingual model handles Thai text effectively
Scalable: Can easily add more PDFs to the knowledge base
More Accurate: Finds relevant content even with different wording

How to Use:
Run the chatbot: source venv/bin/activate && python chatbot.py
Add more PDFs: Modify init_vector_db.py and run it again
Test queries: Use test_chatbot.py for automated testing
The vector database is stored in ./chroma_db and persists between sessions.
